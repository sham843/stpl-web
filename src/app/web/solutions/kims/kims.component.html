                Issue and receipt of weapons in a subunitâ€™s Kote, is an extremely time-consuming process, due to it
                encompassing entries of accurate figures, and simultaneously ensuring the issue to the right person.
                This
                process, on average, takes approximately 3-4 min per individual; in turn, a battalion individual would
                take
                around 3 hours for the complete issue procedure. While this time-consuming process is quite acceptable
                in
                peacetime, the ramifications of the same for a speedy mob of a unit are not acceptable.

            <p>
                Shaurya Technosoft Pvt Ltd had devised an automated software-based system, which allows for the
                automated process of individual and GP issue/receipt of SAs from a battalion Kote the system is
                described as under:

                <strong>A. Bar Coding :</strong>
                Each weapon (Rifle 5.56mm/CMG/LMG) and its mag have been barcoded. The bar code with its unique
                individual code is printed on each weapon and mag.

                <strong>B. Bar Code Scanning :</strong>
                The barcode reader reads the barcode in a split second and displays all info with respect to the
                particular visual, his photograph, and his weapon; as a result, the Kote NCO instead of entering various
                figures in
                ledgers/ registers/ document, just scans the barcode to enter the read data fields for issue/receipt.

                <strong>C. Finger Print Scanner: :</strong>
                The fingerprint scanner ensures that the individual digitally signs his issue/ receipt action which
                again is a very prompt process and hence obviates any wastage of time. It simultaneously renders
                authenticity, accuracy, andswiftness to the operation and also ensures that the weapon is issued only to
                the individual that whom it has been allocated to.
