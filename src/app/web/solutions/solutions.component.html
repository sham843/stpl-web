                    The Revenue Department of the Government of Maharashtra had been endeavouring to set up a monitoring
                    system in the State for various revenue sources of the Department. It was pertinent not only for
                    revenue growth but also for improving the service delivery and attaining the development goals of
                    the Department. This initiative aids the Department in making a reasonable advancement in terms of
                    maintaining a database related to minerals, registered agencies, lease period, renewals, tracking
                    and monitoring the movement of minerals, payment processes, recovery procedures, and so on.
